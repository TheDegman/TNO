The German Reich reigns supreme from the Atlantic sea to the once great city of Moscow, ruling Europe with an iron fist. Thousands live and die everyday under German tyranny, yearning for a freedom that may never come.&#10;&#10;But all is not well in the Reich.&#10;&#10;Hitler lays on his deathbed even as the first German raumsonaut lands on the moon, and already the vultures pick at his corpse. Albert Speer, Martin Bormann, Hermann Göring and Reinhard Heydrich each prepare to take power in the Reich, and the world waits with baited breath for the storm that is surely coming. Outside of the Reichstag in the megacity of Germania, partisans prepare for their final struggle, and Heinrich Himmler plots to bring the world to the edge from his spartanist utopia in the Ordenstaat of Burgundy.&#10;&#10;Across the seas, the United States gathers allies to prevent the fall of democracy in the world, struggling to contain its own politics long enough to tear up the treaties that had ended the Second World War.&#10;&#10;In Asia, the Japanese Empire groans under the weight of rivals within as well as without, as a hundred different cultures struggle and begin to cooperate in the goal of finally overthrowing their slaveholder.&#10;&#10;In the Mediterraenan, an old alliance feuds with itself. A reformer in Italy seeks to create a hotbed of democracy in Europe as an aging Franco fights to keep control of Iberia.&#10;&#10;"
